This TINA Schematic can be opened in TINA-TI and simulated using TINA-TI. 

TINA-TI provides all the conventional DC, transient and frequency domain 
analysis of SPICE and much more. TINA has extensive post-processing capability 
that allows you to format results the way you want them. Virtual instruments 
allow you to select input waveforms and probe circuit nodes voltages and waveforms. 
TINA's schematic capture is truly intuitive - a real "quickstart."

TINA-TI installation requires approximately 500MB. Installation is straight-forward
 and it can be uninstalled easily, if you wish. We bet that you won't.

TINA is a product of DesignSoft exclusively for Texas Instruments. 
This complimentary version is fully functional but does not support some other 
features available with the full version of TINA.
